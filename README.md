# Android orientation locker

This is my fork of eyedeekay's fork of Peng Huang's FOSS rotation locker for Android.

You can cycle through **portrait orientation locked** --> **landscape orientation locked** --> **orientation unlocked** states by clicking the app icon.

There is a toast message for each state switch.

I removed the notification area icon and updated the German translation.

The new binary is at **bin/RotationLockpp_TW.apk** .
